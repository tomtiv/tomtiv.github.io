If you happen to know either Sam or me personally please keep it to yourself. At no point am I tryign to blame, shame or any otehr kind of negative action to anyoen else. We are all just doing the best we can with the tools we have. If you choose to cause someone unnecessary grief, you may not like the outcome.   

And now the FAQ   
   
Q: Are the names real?   
A: Yes, No, Maybe, No idea?!?   
   
Q: Why make this public?   
A: It's public-ish, I'm not advertising it, but my support team, therapists and some others know about it.   

Q: Do you regret your relationship with Sam   
A: Yes and No... I don't regret being with her, she's become the most important person in my life. She's a lot more than just the things I talk about on here. However I do regret that we spent so much time and energy trying to make things work, we both desperately wanted to be together but we never took the time to figure out what we needed to fix and what were just personality diffrences.   
   
Q: Will you enable comments?   
A: Probably, but I'll likely wait until I have filled the backlog of posts.      

Q: Why commit to posting for one year after?   
A: I guess I wanted to experience everything for myself again. I know this is somethign I never want to experience again, so doing it for a  year seems like a way to keep me on track.   

Q: How and where did you find that kind of counselling?      
A: I have no idea, I got so lucky and I am so thankful! I have no idea where I would be without my angels. I dont feel confotable sharing the details of the people and orginization I am working with, but that may chnage in the future... It's also not just my decisions and I have to respect that.
