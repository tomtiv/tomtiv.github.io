I've been trying to write a final post for a long time now, but every time I try I still have so much I want to say. I wish I could say that I am doing better and I am moving forward, I wish I could say the pain has eased, but it hasn't. As much work as I've done and all the soul searching I have done is, I'm told something to be proud of and I guess to some degree I am but it's like I've been frozen in time.  I miss Sam everday, I cry every day and I feel so utterly lost in the darkness.

I wont give up on myself and I will fight everyday, but I truly wanted to share just how hard this has been for me. I guess it really is just like the sentiment goes, it takes time and hard work. A life isn't created in a day and while it may seem like it can be destroyed in a day, life isn't over, it's just going to take time to rebuild.


Thanks for reading about my silly little life!
