I tried to call Sam at work, I felt terrible about last night. A co-worker picked up and to my shock told me that Sam wasn't scheduled to work today. I didn't know what to do, I was being lied to, did Sam ask them to do that? I stuggled to find sometign to say, and out came my cat is having seizures, can I bring him in. I can't beleive I said that, this is going to make things worse.

Just after lunch I got Sam's "I hate you, I'm done", email again, I can't count how many times she's sent that to me. She wrote I see thoguh you, what the hell does that mean? Why can't we stop doing this crap to each other, neitehr of us mean any of it. We have to find a way to communicate.
