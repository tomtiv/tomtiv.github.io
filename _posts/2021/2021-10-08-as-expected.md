I tried to call her at work, I felt terrible about last night. A co-worker picked up and to my shock told me that she wasn't shceduled to work today. I didn't know what to do, I was being lied to, did she ask them to do that? I stuggled to find sometign to say, and our came my cat is having seizures, can I bring him in. I can't beleive I said that, this is goign to make things worse.

Just after lunch I got her I hate you, I'm done, email again, I can't count how many times she's sent that to me. She wrote I see thoguh you, what the hell does that mean? Why can't we stop doing this crap to each other, neitehr of us mean any of it. We have to find a way to communicate.
