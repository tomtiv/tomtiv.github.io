It doesn't take much to destroy everything you love. A single comment, an emotional trigger or plain stupidity.

I was so angry, I didn't feel it coming on, I just expolded with rage. I lashed out at Sam and said terrible things.
The trully messed up thind is that I have no idea what I was mad at, nothing bad has been going on with us lately. 

We had started to talk to each other about things that we were unhappy about. They weren't the best conversations, but no one was yelling, no one was leaving. I couldn't have been happpier about it. I wonder how long she will take to come home, I really hate this.
