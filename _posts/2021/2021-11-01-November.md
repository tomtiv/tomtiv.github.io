November was pretty much a blur, I had so much goinng on. I was about to take my finals to finish collge, I was woking on my capstone project. Every other moment I was in tears, trying to understand what was happening, what was going to happen. Nothing made sense to me, I'd never heard of anything like this before. She was a ghost, she left me to deal with everything.
