I fully support people using labels to help themselves understand behaviours and learn healthy and constructive behaviours.   
Using lables like Narcisist, BiPolar or Borderline and extremely dangerous labels to throw around.   
People are know adding the word traits after, thinking that makes it better, it doesn't   

It seams that a lot people are using Cluster B labels or traits to absolve themselves of responsability. 
If someone hurts you or does somerthign you don;t understand or agree with, Cluster B is not the reason.
   
There's a reason  only a doctor can diagnose these mental illneses   
Would you want your doctor telling you if your electrical panel is safe to use?   
    
I'm no expert but I can relate to this, most people feel that they are a little ADHD, but that is lightyears away from acually having ADHD.
