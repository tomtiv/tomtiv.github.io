I've never been all that attached to singers or bands, I'm a lyrical person. Any song that makes me feel somethign I like.   
I couldn't care less what genre it is or what others think about the song.
   
I heard Drivers License and that hit home, but everytime I heard a new song that I liked it turned out to be by Olivia.
She can sing and write, It's a great album. I love that she doesn't have to belt out every note to be effective, when she goes small it's just as powerful. I have no idea who or what she is writing about, but her lyrics are fantastic and I can honestly say there's not a single song I don't like.   
   
I've never gone and watched reaction videos, but I was curious what people thought about her album and it's pretty universal, it's amazing.
