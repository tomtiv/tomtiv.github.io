I've never been all that attached to singers or bands, I'm a lyrical person. Any song that makes me feel somethign I like.   
I couldn't care less what genre it is or what other think abou the song.   
    
I heard Drivers License and that hit home, but everytime I heard a new song that I liked it turned out to be by Olivia.
She can sing and write, It's a great album.
