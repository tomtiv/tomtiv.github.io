__Lyrics__   
>   
> I knew a girl thst was smart, pretty 
> Her parents hated who she loved, 
> She couldn't wait to go to college   
> She was tired 'cause she was brought Into a world where family was merely blood   
> Does she know how proud I am she was created   
> With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred   
>
> We don't talk much but I just gotta say, "I miss you, and I hope that you're okay"   
> God, I hope that you're happier today 'Cause I love you, and I hope that you're okay
