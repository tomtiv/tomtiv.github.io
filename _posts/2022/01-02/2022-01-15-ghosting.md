Don't fucking do it... If you really need someone to explain to you why it's terrbile, life went seriously wrong for you.
   
it's a terrble thing to do to someone, and ghosting is not the same as a clean break!
- At best you wre just avoiding your own problems
- At worst you can really cause a lot of damage to everyone involved and possibly devistating to the one that loves you.
