I was distracted And in traffic, I didn't feel it When the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'Were you out drinkin'? 
Were you in the living room Chillin' watchin' television?
It's been a year now, Think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

But if the world was ending, You'd come over, right? right?

I tried to imagine Your reaction It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin' That night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house And didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now Think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out
