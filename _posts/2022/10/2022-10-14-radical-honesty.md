This is what I thought about when I heard the term radical honesty, I actually didn't think the way I thought was good at all, but with Zee's help I can see that the way I think about this is actually very healthy.  
  
***Hypothetical (hopefully) Obviously***

I'm not over Sam, I am still very much in love with her but I'm not holding on to hope either, but it's nice to know that it's ok to feel this way. I also have my first true boundary with another person. I would not be receptive to any kind of interaction with Sam if she just showed up at my door or ran into each other in public, but if she got in contact with me in a respectful way then I would be open to hearing what she had to say.  

It's a small boundary but a boundary none the less.
