Cute Aggression is the phenomenon when you see something really cute or something you want to protect your emotions can be overwhelming and you want to pinch that cute babies cheeks or squish that really cute fuzzy kitten. It's not just about animals and babies either.  

There's a strange behavior that I have ad for as long as I can remember, it was very prevalent while I was with Sam. Frequently I would poke, pinch, bite or prod at Sam. I would do this quite a lot and in all kinds of different situations. I know it annoyed her to no end, but I wasn't do it to annoy her, I wasn't really sure why I did it. It's great to find out tht there is a reason why I would do the things I would do.
