It's still unclear if I qualify clinically for Borderline Personality Disorder or not, I absolutely have strong BPD tendencies. Over the past month since I had my assessment, I've bounced back and forth trying to understand where I fit. I found a few good resource that helped me understand that it didn't really matter, I have things that I need to sort out and that's ok.  

Knowing that there was more to me than just ADHD which never really fit completely anyway is at the very least a new place to work from. I'm also saying this publicly for the first time in my life, which is a bit scary but I think worth it.
  
I have Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder as well as Borderline Personality Disorder.
