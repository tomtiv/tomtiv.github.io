__Lyrics__
>  
> I've been left out, lied to, talked about and used
> Stared down and laughed at while walking out of school
> You wanna put the blame on me, the feeling's nothing new
> You wanna hang more pain on me, there's nothing you can do>
> A moment lasts inside this coffin, I'm buried often
>
> Just show up and show love, just want you near me
> But like, does that even feel right?
>
