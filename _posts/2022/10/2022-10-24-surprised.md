Tomorrow, I finally have my appointment with my GP to speak about the assessment I had early September, I was very lucky in regards to my GP for a long time, she took absolutely amazing care of me. Over the past couple of years I haven't felt like she was there for me in any capacity more than filling prescriptions, which is a challenge at the best of times now. I don't know what changed but something changed  

I feel like it has a lot to do with Sam and me, and it's not like I don;t understand why this happens but it's easy for people to see her as a young naive woman, but that simply isn't true and it feels really awful to constantly be seen that way.
