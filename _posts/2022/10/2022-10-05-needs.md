I heard this on the youtube channel howtoadhd.  
"I believe that you have the greater need right now, and I don't want to neglect mine, so what should do?"  

That hit me like a tonne of bricks and I burst into tears, like she said, I had no idea that was even an option. I hope I am able to integrate this into my beliefs moving forward
