40 days until this summers cottage vacation, it also happens to fall on what would have been Sam and my 5 yr anniversary.  
I can't remember being so scared of something I would normally be excited for. This will be the 4th year we have done it, every single year it's been the same, Sam and I have 1 blow out fight and then the rest of the vacation is amazing. Some of the best memories I have of us are at the cottage.  
  
Last year, I took her down to 15 ft and we sat and looked at each other making hearts and kisses at each other. There was also the midnight snorkel and the helicopter but we don't discuss that.
