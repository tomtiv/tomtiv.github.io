I woke up in a panic attack in the middle of the night, I spent almost the full day like that. I couldn't ground myself, I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't catch my breath. I was waiting for my seesion with El to start, and once I saw her I lost it. I cried as hard as I could, I knew I was safe in that moment so I let it all out. It felt good to drop all the weight I had been carrying even if it's only for a short time.
