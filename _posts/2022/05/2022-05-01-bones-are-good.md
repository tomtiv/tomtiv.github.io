> We're in the homestretch of the high times   
> We took a hard left But we're alright   
> Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but   
> We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it   
> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
>    
> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter  
> Let it break 'cause you and I remain the same     
> When there ain't a crack in the foundation     
> Baby, I know any storm we're facing   
> Will blow right over while we stay put   
> The house don't fall when the bones are good   
>
> Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I   
> Can't even mess it up although we both try   
> No, it don't always go the way we planned it   
> But the wolves came and went and we're still standing    
> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
