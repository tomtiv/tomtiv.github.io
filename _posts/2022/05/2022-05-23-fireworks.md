I went to the beaches to watch the fireworks by myself tonight. It was a huge revelation for me. I don't think I knew just how much of my life I had to rebuild, I lost everything, including who I thought I was.  
  
Seeing all kinds of couples cuddled together starting the summer off with a bang, it was hard, I held back my tears as best I could. I thought I could start to take back my life and have a decent summer, but having hell week weighing on my. I don't think this will be a greta summer, but I'm hoping I can find a way to enjoy myself ina small way.
