Most of my life I didn't know who, what or even how I could count on to be there for me.
I've always heard that men are less emotional and struggle to share thier emotions.   
I've always been an emotional guy, right or wrong I use my emotions\feelings as my northern star.   
   
I like who I am , I'm not ashamed of any of my scares.
every scar I have is from fighting for someone or something I love.
