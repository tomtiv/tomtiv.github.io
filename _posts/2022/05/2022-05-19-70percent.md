I've come across this statistic a half dozen times, it's hard to wrap my head around it.    
70 % of a couples issues will never be solved. A healthy couple will deal wtth what they can and find ways around what they can't.
I wish I knew that, I have a very bad habit of wanting to fix everything right away. 
Knowing I could just let things go and that it didn't mean I didn't love her, would have made somethigns much easier.
