 I feel as though my psyche fractured into two pieces, it didn't fracture into two separate and equal parts.  
 it's more like a highway, with each piece being the direction the highway runs. I can take any number of ways,  
 but there are only ever 2 distinct destinations and I rarely know which path I am on at any time.  

So in my session with zee today I decided to share my entire story with her, I get anxious thinking about sharing my story.  
Sam is the only person that knows my entire story, and there was one other person that knew most of my story, but not all.  
Even though I didn't have the emotional vocabulary while we were together, I'm still amazed how much I shared with her.
