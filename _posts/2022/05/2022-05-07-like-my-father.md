The song's video hit me like a truck, it was like watching the life I had started with her.
it's the life I thought I was about to start. How could I ever have known how wrong I would be.

I wanna come home to roses
And dirty little notes on Post-its
And when my hair starts turning gray
He'll say I'm like a fine wine, better with age
I guess I learned it from my parents
That true love starts with friendship
A kiss on the forehead, a date night

Fake an apology after a fight
I need a man who's patient and kind
Gets out of the car and holds the door
I wanna slow dance in the living room like
We're 18 at senior prom and grow
Old with someone who makes me feel young
I need a man who loves me like
My father loves my mom

I want a road trip in the summers
I wanna make fun of each other
I wanna rock out to Billy Joel
And flip our kids off when they call us old
He'll accidentally burn our dinner
And let me be the scrabble winner
And when my body changes shapes
He'll say, "Oh my God, you look hot today"
I need a man who's patient and kind
Gets out of the car and holds the door
I wanna slow dance in the living room like
We're 18 at senior prom and grow
Old with someone who makes me feel young
I need a man who loves me like
My father loves my mom

And if he lives up to my father
Maybe he could teach our daughter
What it takes to love a queen
She should know she's royalty
I need a man who's patient and kind
Gets out of the car and holds the door
I wanna slow dance in the living room like
We're 18 at senior prom and grow
Old with someone who makes me feel young
I need a man who loves me like
My father loves my mom
I need a man who loves me like
My father loves my mom
