Do you ever feel like you are being punished excessively and you really should know why, but you don't? I went to see "Dr Strange: Into the Multiverse", It only took 10 min to regret going to see the movie. They reveal the motivation for the 2 main characters and it hit way too close to home  

Dr Strange learns that he cannot be with the love of his life, Christine, in any universe.
Scarlet Witch is willing to destroy the entire multiverse to have her kids with her, even if it hurts her children.  

Are you serious! Just what I needed
