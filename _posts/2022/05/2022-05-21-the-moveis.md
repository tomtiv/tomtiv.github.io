Do you ever feel like you are being punished excessivly and you really should know why, but you dont?   

I went to see "Dr Strange: Into the Multiverse", It only took 10 min to regret going to see the movie.   
They reveal the motivation for the 2 main charecters and it hit way too close to home.   

He learns that ub every universe, he is never able to be with the woman he loves
She is willing to destroy the entire multiverse to have her kids with her, even at the determent to her kids.

Are you F$@#% serious! Just what I needed
