40 days until this summers cottage vacation, it also happens to fall on what would have been Sam and my 5 yr anniversary.   
I can't remember being so scared of something I would normally be excitied for. This will be the 4th year we have done it, every single year it's been the same, Sam and I have 1 blow out figh and htne the rest of the vacation is amazing. Some of the best momories I have of us are at the cottage.   
   
Last year, I took her down to 15 ft and we sat and looked at each other making hearts and kisses at each other. There was also the midnight snorkle and the helicopter but we don't discuss that.
