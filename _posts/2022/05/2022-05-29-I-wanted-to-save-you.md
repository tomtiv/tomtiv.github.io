I heard a song on my walk, that I had never heard before, I could;t think of hearing any song even remotely close to it.
It's not a breakup song, it's so much more than that, It's a reality check. I don't ever remember a song making me feel this way before.

The song was called Flowers and almost immediately after hearing the song I felt sick to my stomach,
I got a bit dizzy and felt like I was going to throw up, It was the worst and darkest emotion/feeling
that I have had over the past 8 months.

I felt things for Sam that I had never felt for her before, I felt sad for her, I pitied her and I was ashamed of her, I was finally done with her. I'm free to make decisions without caring how she reacts, how it affects her or how she feels about it. I'm a lot of things, I make a lot of mistakes, but I always do my best to be a good person, even the times I'm not, I try to find a way to make amends for my words or actions.

Sam you had one responsibility, not just to me, but to yourself, your pets,
and to everyone that you have so frequently and so easily taken advantage of.
You couldn't be a decent human being to the person you claimed to love for close to 5 years.
I guess I was never anything more than another Bus Driver to you.
