So much has happened with these past few weeks, all coming to a place where I could accept my situation. I guess I thought acepting it would make it easier but it hasn't. I contacted Zena hoping for a session today, and of course hse said yes. I was very happy I reached out and asked for help I felt better after we spoke, for a hhile anyway. I guess that's the best I can ask for right now, I'll feel better for a litte bit and maybe next time is a little bit longer evern if it's just a minute or 2 longer.
