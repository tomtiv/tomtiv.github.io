So much has happened with these past few weeks, all coming to a place where I could accept my situation. I guess I thought accepting it would make it easier but it hasn't. I contacted Zee hoping for a session today, and of course hse said yes. I was very happy I reached out and asked for help I felt better after we spoke, for a while anyway. I guess that's the best I can ask for right now, I'll feel better for a little bit and maybe next time is a little bit longer even if it's just a minute or 2 longer.
