I've come across this statistic a half dozen times, it's hard to wrap my head around it.  
70 percent of a couples issues will never be solved. A healthy couple will deal with what they can and find ways around what they can't.
I wish I knew that, I have a very bad habit of wanting to fix everything right away.  
Knowing I could just let things go and that it didn't mean I didn't love her, would have made somethings much easier.
