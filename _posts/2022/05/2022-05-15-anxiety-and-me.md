I have walked close to 80 km in the past 2 days, no matter how hard I troed I coulnd't get my anxiety under control. I felt so out of control, my mind wouldn't stop. I just can't stop thinking about her, I miss her like crazy. I don't know hot to let go, how do you let go of the thign you love the most in the world.
