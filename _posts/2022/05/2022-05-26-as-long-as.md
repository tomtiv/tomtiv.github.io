The phrase "As long as ", is something i have always believed in, I don't know where I learned it, and I can't remember anyone saying it to to me. It's something that allowed me to move pass my mistakes and try again, it allowed me to forgive others and ask that they try again. It was something I said to Sam often in regards to her episodes. I am ok, I can handle and I would never leave you because of your episodes, AS Long As you are trying to understand them, I'm here and it's ok.  

I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing from the other person's perspective, but I have always meant it when I said it.
