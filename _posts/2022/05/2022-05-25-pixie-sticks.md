   EL had to take the day off, as she wasn't feeling well. I was bummed to not have her tell me what to do for an hour!      
   Just kidding, I was trying to find the best way to describe what EL feels like to me... 
   I turned my brain off and it hit me right away.   
   She's my annoying, thinks she is always right, and a lot of the time is right, little Sister.

   So why I read she was sick all I could think of was her on the floor is a pixie dust haze!
