EL had to take the day off, as she wasn't feeling well. I was kind of bummed, not have her tell me what to do for an hour!

 Just kidding, I was trying to find the best way to describe what EL feels like to me... 
 I turned my brain off and it hit me right away, she's my annoying, thinks she is always right (often is) little Sister.
 So when I read she was sick all I could think of was her passed out on the floor is a pixie dust haze!
    
Hope you feel better soon!
