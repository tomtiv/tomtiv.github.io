My Bday Debackle 2020...  

Sam arrived home almost 3 hrs late from work on my birthday, I knew she wasn't stuck at work that long and I had no idea wherer she was.
She arrived and gave me my bday girft, which is what took her so long to get home. It was a pizza shaped as a heart. It wasn't a piece with a slice cut out or somethign lame, she actually got them to make the pizza in the shape of a heart.   

This came up in a session with zee, she thought that was very sweet and not something most people would do. I agreed with that, the issue was that Sam and I have diffrent love languages, at the time neother of us even knew we had love languages.    

For me quality time is number 1 by a landslide, words of affirmation, acts of services and then gifts. Sam's love language was act's of service, quality time, words of affimation then gifts. Even though it doesn;lt look very diffrent between us, since we weren;t even aware of this concept often we both felt as if we spoke completely diffrent languages and some of our problems felt impossible to solve.
