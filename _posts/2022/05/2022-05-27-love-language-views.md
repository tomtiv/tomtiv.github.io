Terrible bday 2020...  

Sam arrived home almost 3 hrs late from work on my birthday, I knew she wasn't stuck at work that long and I had no idea where she was.
She arrived and gave me my bday gift, which is what took her so long to get home. It was a pizza shaped as a heart. It wasn't a piece with a slice cut out or something lame, she actually got them to make the pizza in the shape of a heart.  

This came up in a session with zee, she thought that was very sweet and not something most people would do. I agreed with that, the issue was that Sam and I have different love languages, at the time neither of us even knew we had love languages.  

For me quality time is number 1 by a landslide, words of affirmation, acts of services and then gifts. Sam's love language was act's of service, quality time, words of affirmation then gifts. Our love languages aren't all that different, but when you aren't even aware of the issue it tends to make make hte problems feel much bigger between us. Not even being aware of these concepts often we both felt as if we spoke completely different languages and some of our problems felt impossible to solve.

If I had of known how to express that I love that she wants to do things for me, but please try to remember that I would rather be with you then get something from you.
