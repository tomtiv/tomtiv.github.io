- You got me fucked up in the head, Never doubted myself so much
- Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, girl? 
- I hate that I give you power over that kind of stuff
- 'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
- I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
- It's always one step forward and three steps back
- Do you love me, want me, hate me? 
- Girl, I don't understand, No, I don't understand
