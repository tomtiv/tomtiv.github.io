I would have thought this would be an easy emotion to describe, but I can't describe it without tell you all about the one I love.
This emotion is 100% attached to her, I have vivid memories of us together, having a stupid grin on my face, feeling like there was something physically connecting us together, almost like a lighting bolt. I feel so safe, I feel complete.

One of my biggest regrets is that I that if anyone tried to take this from me, I would fight to the death to protect it.
A couple of times, I forgot that I needed to protect the one I loved not the feeling, without her there's nothign worth fightng for.
