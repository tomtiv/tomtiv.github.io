I Think we all know anger pretty well, but for me it wasn't as easy. Anxiety and anger are opposites in the way I feel them wihtin me. Anxiety is a pulse starting in my chest and poulsing outwords. Anger start from the tips of my limps or my head. It starts to pulse further and further inwards towards my chest.
