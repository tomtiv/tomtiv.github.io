I have 2 co-morbidities to my ADHD which are Opposition Defiance Disorder (ODD) and Rejection Sensitivity Disorder (RSD)

ODD doesnlt really have much of an impact onmy life anymore, earlier in life I would struggle with people telling me to do things without telling me why it needed to be done. 
   
RSD on the other hand is almost as bad as ADHD itself, I know most people can compartmentalize thier emotions, but I can't. Having a fight with my partner, triggers my seperation anxiety, which in turn takes over all control and I lose any emotional stability. If Sam was to go to work upset, I would spend the day in distress, probobly doing somethign to make the situatioin worse as well.   
   
My ADHD meds help a lot with this, but th eproblem is most people are only given ADHD meds to get through the day, when most, damn near all of my personal interactions happen at night when my meds have worn off.
