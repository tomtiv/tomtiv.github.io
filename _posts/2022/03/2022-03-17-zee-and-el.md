I really like having both El and Zee on my team. They have completely diffrent styles. Zee and I tend ot explore anything and everything.   
Without trying ot mind read we try to explain things that don't make sense. El and I tend to stay a bit more grounded and try to find ways to use my realizations, pain and sadness to make real change.
