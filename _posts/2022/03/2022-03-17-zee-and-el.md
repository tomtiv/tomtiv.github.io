I really like having both El and Zee on my team. They have completely different styles.   
   
Zee and I tend to explore anything and everything Without trying to mindread, we try to explain things that don't make sense.
El and I tend to stay a bit more grounded and try to find ways to use my realizations, pain and sadness to make real change. 

There's a familiarity in EL, it's hard to say exactly what it is but it's definitely there.
