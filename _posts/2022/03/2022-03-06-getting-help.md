I couldn't get through this alone, I looked everwhere adn spoke to everyone I could find trying to get help. 
I'm not looking to blame anyone, everything costs money and with mental health being accepted into main stream it's even harder to get.
Somehow I came across a chain of people that lead me to my angels, EL and Zena. Honest to goodness I have no idea how they could even understand what I was saying to them. I was so emotionaly charged and my anxiewty was through the rough.
   
They offerd to help, it was a pretty big commitment they were offering. I would have 4 sessions a week
- 1 group session
- 1 sessions with EL
- 2 sessions with Zena (She's the crisis counsellor) 
   
I of course said yes, and that's how they became my angels.
