>
> Brown guilty eyes and little white lies.  Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
> That you'd talk to her, maybe did even worse, I kept quiet so I could keep you
> And ain't it funny, How you ran to her, The second that we called it quits?
> And ain't it funny  How you said you were friends?
> Now it sure as hell don't look like it
> You betrayed me
> And I know that you'll never feel sorry, For the way I hurt, yeah
> You'd talk to her, When we were together
> I Loved you at your worst But that didn't matter
> Guess you didn't cheat, But you're still a traitor
