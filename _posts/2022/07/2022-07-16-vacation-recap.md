I  haven't written anything in over a month, it's not because I don;t want to or that I have nothing to say. It's that it feels overwhelming, that this is too much that has happened and I've processed and started to understand so many things now. I'm going to try and do shorter posts and see if I can talk about the major things that I am experiencing, feeling or thinking. At some point I will write about the cottage but there is so much to write, it's gonna take some time.
