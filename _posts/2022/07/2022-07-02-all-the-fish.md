I'd only been here once, it was a little more than 5 years ago.  I was finishing work at the same time as Sam so I decided to offer her a ride home. She accepted and on the way asked if I wanted to stop for a coffee and go to the park. I probably would have asked her if she hadn't asked me first so I was happy to spend time with her. This was the first time we had ever spent any time together, we went to Centennial park, Sam took me to this cute little bridge where we just hung out and talked. I remember her telling me that she had never dated and that she didn't think guys liked her. This was comical to me, she had a guy standing right in front of her that was very interested. I'm not sure how long we were there, it felt like time had stopped for us. When we were finished I drove her home and when we got to her house I asked her if I could give her a hug, I still remember that bewildered look on her face, I can't say for sure what she was thinking but I am fairly certain she was shocked that I was interested in her, but I was and I wanted her to know that. From that day on we were almost inseparable, that was the beginning of our story. I have always known that I wanted to go back there with Sam, I thought it would be the perfect place to take our first adventure as a family and our first child.  

Things don't work out the way we want most of the time, life gets in the way, I knew I would never have that special moment I had planned in my head. So I decided if I was going to go back to that bridge there's no better day than our would have been 5 years together. When I go there I wasn't sure if I would be able to find the bridge, I wasn't paying attention the first time. It walked for a long time and started to think I wouldn't find it, but eventually I fond what I thought was the remains of our 1st time. I was disappointed, it felt wrong so as I started back to my car I kept looking to see if I was wrong and a few minutes later, I found the real bridge. I felt pretty awful once I had found the real bridge, it felt poetic, it just reminded me what we had done, we found this great thing together and instead of taking care of it, we let it rot away right under our feet.
