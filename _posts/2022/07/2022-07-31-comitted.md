I'm not sure it was a conscience decision or an emotional decision but shortly after Sam left I decided that I would fight for us for 6 months. That may sound extreme to some and it probably was but I truly loved her and wanted to work it out. I did my best to be respectful and not stalk or do anything that could cause problems. I went to her work once, that was 3 weeks after, to be fair I was still in shock. I send her a bunch of emails, usually once a week maybe twice and then less and less as the months went on. I have no idea what any of my emails said I was so emotional back then.  

I guess my point is that I'm not sure what the right thing to do was, if I had of gone no contact would she have reached out?
Would things have been different? What I realize now though is what I did back then really didn't matter. I needed to heal and to make some drastic changes. I couldn't have done that while I was with Sam. That's not her fault or anything to do with her, Sam and my relationship wouldn't;t allow for change and I desperately needed change.  

I couldn't answer if I would do it all over again before but I can now. No I wouldn't do it again, but that's because I have healed and grown as a person, our relationship was exactly what it was and what it needed to be. I will always love Sam and she will always be part of me.
