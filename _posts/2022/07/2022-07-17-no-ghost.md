I;ve been back home for a couple of days and I've had the strangest feeling since I got back home. There's no more ghost here, it doesn't feel like something is missing, it doesn't feel like this is Sam and my place anymore. It's just my home, there's no reminders of her, there's nothing left of her. It's a really good and bad feeling at the same time.
