I'm sure most people know this stuff already but I've had to learn these things a very hard way.

They seem simple but when these types of behaviors have been part of your entire life it's not so easy to understand. This week I want to go over some of my and Sam's behaviors that we both did but were unaware had a much bigger effect than we knew.  

- You Always or You Never
- Silent Treatment
- Impatient
- Sorry But
- Reacting Instead Of Responding
- I'm Not Good Enough
- Bad Things With Good Intensions
  
And The MOST IMPORTANT NOT COMMUNICATING
