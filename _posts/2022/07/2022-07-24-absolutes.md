I am extremely guilty of this terrible behavior, I probably said this to Sam hundreds of times, she Always or Never did something. It's simply not true, No one does anything always or never. I realize that saying this to Sam probably made her feel badly about herself or maybe even that she wasn't good enough, but again that simply isn't true.
