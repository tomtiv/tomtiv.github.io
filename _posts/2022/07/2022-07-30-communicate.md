Both Sam and I failed at this one, there are the obvious reasons for this. For me I didn't understand and sometimes was completely unaware of my feelings or emotions. For Sam it was likely she didn't know how to communicate or how important it was that she shared her thoughts and her feelings.  

The real issue with not communicating is that it's not possible, not for very long anyway. The things that you don't talk about WILL come out in ways you didn't intend. It almost always has a much worse affect then just having constant conversations and in the end it is very much, a big reason why Sam and I couldn't make it work.
