I finally decided to go and see the new top gun movie.
HOLY SHIT, HOLY SHIT, HOLY SHIT...  
  
Top Gun: Maverick is one of the best movies I have ever seen, it had me emotionally invested immediately and it never let up. The movie didn't rely on the original, it had great references but it had no problem standing on it's own. If you haven't seen it you have to see it the first time in the theater, it makes The Avenger movies look like the lego movie.
