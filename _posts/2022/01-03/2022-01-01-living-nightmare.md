Schools has finished and the holidays have passed, I have no idea what I am suppose to do now.  

I have been looking forward to this for 3 years, I worked so damn hard to make it to this point. I've never felt this kind of pain in my life, I can barely function. I barely eat or sleep, I cry all day everyday. How does someone go from telling you how much they love you to ghosting you in barely 24 hrs.  
  
The worst part is I don't have a grasp on reality anymore, I'm questioning the entire relationship all 4+ years of it. Was I really just a fool, had she been playing mwe all this time? I feel hard for her and I've never looked back. I just accepted everything she threw at me and told myself she can''t control it. I feel so stupid, I feel like giving up, I really don't know if I have it in me to fight through this.
