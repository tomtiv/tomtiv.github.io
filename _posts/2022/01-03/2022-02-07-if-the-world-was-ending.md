> I was distracted And in traffic, I didn't feel it When the earthquake happened   
> But it really got me thinkin' Were you out drinkin'?   
> Were you in the living room Chillin' watchin' television?   
> It's been a year now, Think I've figured out how   
> How to let you go and let communication die out   
>   
> But if the world was ending, You'd come over, right? right?   
>   
> I tried to imagine Your reaction It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened   
> But it really got me thinkin' That night we went drinkin'   
> Stumbled in the house And didn't make it past the kitchen   
> Ah, it's been a year now Think I've figured out how   
> How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out
