I couldn't get through this alone, I looked everywhere adn spoke to everyone I could find trying to get help.  
I'm not looking to blame anyone, everything costs money and with mental health being accepted into main stream it's even harder to get.  
Somehow I came across a chain of people that lead me to my angels, EL and Zee. Honest to goodness I have no idea how they could even understand   what I was saying to them. I was so emotionally charged and my anxiety was through the rough.  
  
They offered to help, it was a pretty big commitment they were offering. I would have 4 sessions a week  

* 1 group session
* 1 sessions with EL
* 2 sessions with Zee (She's the crisis counsellor)
  
I of course said yes, and that's how they became my angels.
