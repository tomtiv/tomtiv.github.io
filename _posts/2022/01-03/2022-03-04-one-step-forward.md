> You got me fucked up in the head, Never doubted myself so much   
> Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, girl?   
> I hate that I give you power over that kind of stuff   
> 'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back   
> I'm the love of your life until I make you mad   
> It's always one step forward and three steps back   
> Do you love me, want me, hate me?    
> Girl, I don't understand,    
> No, I don't understand
