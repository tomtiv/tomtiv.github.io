My frist official session with zee, I have no idea what we talked about. I am stil so emotionaly charged.   
I'm not sure why, but I feel safe talking to her, I don't feel like I want to hide anything.   
That's not a feeling I am familliar with, I don't normally let people see the real me.   
That's reserved for the people I love.
