Don't fucking do it... If you really need someone to explain to you why it's terrible, life went seriously wrong for you.
   
it's a terrible thing to do to someone, and ghosting is not the same as a clean break!
* At best you wre just avoiding your own problems
* At worst you can really cause a lot of damage to everyone involved and possibly devastation to the one that loves you.
