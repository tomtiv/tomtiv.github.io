During the last 8 - 10 months of my relationship with Sam, I knew something was going on inside me, but I didn't have the knowledged of vocabulary to share it with her. Since I really didn't understand what I was feeling, it made just communicating with Sam very difficult.   
   
I often got frustrated and said the wrong thign or worse a mean thing.  I knew if I coudln't find a way to deal with what was ahppeningin inside me, Iwe would lose each other forever. I knew I didn't want that but It's almost certain that has already happened.   
   
I'm not going to let that happen to me again, so over the next few days I'll explore my feelings and emtions.
