I've blamed Sam for everything, I've blamed myself for everything and I've blamed the dispicable outside forces that caused so much damage. There's more than enough blame to go around and no single person or action is at fault. The truth is no amount of blame has made enduring the pain of losing us any easier. Trying to find blame has just made things harder.
