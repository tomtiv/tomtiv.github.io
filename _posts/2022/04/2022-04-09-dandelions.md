How I've always felt about you!

Maybe it's the way you say my name, Maybe it's the way you play your game
I've never known anybody like you, I've never dreamed of nobody like you
I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine
'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions, Wishing on every one that you'll be mine
I see forever in your eyes

Dandelion, into the wind you go, Won't you let my darling know?
