Maybe it's the way you say my name, Maybe it's the way you play your game<!-- pagebreak -->
I've never known anybody like you, I've never dreamed of nobody like you<!-- pagebreak -->
I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine<!-- pagebreak -->
'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions, Wishing on every one that you'll be mine<!-- pagebreak -->
I see forever in your eyes<!-- pagebreak -->
Dandelion, into the wind you go, Won't you let my darling know?<!-- pagebreak -->
