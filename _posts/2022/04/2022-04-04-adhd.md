I have ADHD, it's a complex disorder and has a terrible name. It presents in every person differently,  
what makes it's even more fun is that it will likely present differently in the same person day to day.  
Having ADHD does not mean I am bored or dis-interested or lazy, it is much more complicated then that.  
  
You hear the term flight, fight, freeze or fawn. I have always felt like I was in fight, fight or fight mode.  
This can be debilitating at times and it can make some things feel almost impossible.  

I also have 2 co-morbidities to my ADHD which are  

* Opposition Defiance Disorder (ODD)
* Rejection Sensitivity Disorder (RSD)
  
I'll explore each of theses in a future post
