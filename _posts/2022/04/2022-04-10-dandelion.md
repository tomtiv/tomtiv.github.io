> Maybe it's the way you say my name, Maybe it's the way you play your game      
> I've never known anybody like you, I've never dreamed of nobody like you   
> I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine   
> 'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions, Wishing on every one that you'll be mine   
> I see forever in your eyes   
> Dandelion, into the wind you go, Won't you let my darling know?
