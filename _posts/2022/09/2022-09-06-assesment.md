In a couple days I have my assessment with the major mental health organization in my city, I asked my GP to refer me for an assessment close to 10 months ago. In a weird way I'm glad that it took so long, I'm changed so much since then, I have a new or a first emotional vocabulary that I've never had before. I understand myself so much mor ethan I ever have, and I am so ready for this appointment, it doesn't mater to me what if any diagnoses comes out of it, it's just more information to help me take better care of myself.
