I'm not talking about the movie, I haven't see it, not sure I will bother either.  

The Term "Love & Thunder" very much rings true for me, I've been in a lot of relationships through out my life, but really only 4 of them were significant to me. All of them felt very much like Love and Thunder was what relationships should feel like. When I've attached to someone, I am invested to the core of my soul. Which has been problematic at best, I tend to stay in relationships that I shouldn't be in and I quickly exit relationships that don't feel extreme and therefore don't feel fulfilling to me.  
  
I've never been aware of these dynamics in me before, so hopefully now that I do know about them I can start to make better choices.
