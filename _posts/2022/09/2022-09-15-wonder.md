I know that it takes two to build a relationship and two to destroy a relationship. Even knowing that, I, from time to time have had a thought come to mind. Was this all my fault? Did I do everything I could to push her away until she couldn't take anymore? Was Same always genuine, open and honest? Did I drive away the most important thing I have ever been part of?  I've never been able to definitively answer that question, logically I know that's it's completely false, I know that because if nothing else they way Sam left is more than enough to dispute that kind of thinking.  

Still, I love Sam more than I ever knew was possible, I find myself desperately trying to take all the blame. I hate thinking about her badly, even when things were really bad between us, Sam was still amazing in my eyes and just being around her made me happy. I'm fine with never speaking to her again, but would it be so bad to still see her the way as the love of my life?
