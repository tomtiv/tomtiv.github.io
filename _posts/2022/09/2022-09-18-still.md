I haven't seen or spoken to sam in close to a year and I still feel the same way about her.  
  
I don't think that's a good or bad thing, it's just what is, I can;t control my emotions I can just control the way I respond to them. I've told myself many times that I will always love her and that was ok to feel that way. I never expected that after all this time, I would still have active feelings for her, especially feelings this strong.  

It's possible that this is just limerence and none of my emotions would stand up to an encounter.
