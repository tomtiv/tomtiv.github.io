School has finished and the holidays have passed, I have no idea what I am supposed to do now. My mind feels like it's out of control
I have been looking forward to this for 3 years, I worked so damn hard to make it to this point.
I've never felt this kind of pain in my life, I can barely function. I barely eat or sleep, I cry all day everyday.
How does someone go from telling you how much they love you to ghosting you in barely 24 hrs.
The worst part is I don't have a grasp on reality anymore, I'm questioning the entire relationship all 4+ years of it.
Was I really just a fool, had she been playing me all this time? I feel hard for her and I've never looked back.  
I just accepted everything she threw at me and told myself she can't control it. I feel so stupid, I feel like giving up, I really don't know if I have it in me to fight through this.
