Writing over the last year really helped me to understand and process so many things. Unfrotunatly I also learned a lot of things that made me rethink what I was posting. I've spoent on average 4 hours in counseling and 3 hours researching (watchung or reading) mental health and relationships every week. The online community (youtube, reddit, quora ...) while well meaning has tried to make some very complex issues, very simple and consumable in mere minutes. The problem is that the human brain, psychology and personality are so unbelievablyy complex and it usually takes multiple attempts to even gain insight into our own personalitity and behaviours let alone start to make meanignful and healthy changes.

So to anyone that comes across this, if you are hurting or someone is hurting you, please ask for help! It is not a weekness to ask for help it is very much a strength.  

Healing and growing is hard and it sucks and it takes a lot longer than you would think but it's worth it. Talking to someone is by far the best decision I made, there is no substatute for talking about things.

Thanks for reading about my silly little life!
