It's been slowly building up inside me over the past couple of weeks, I've been thinking about Sam and writing to Sam (not sending) more and more everyday; I miss her like I did months ago and I'm crying lot more again. I'm not 100% sure why I am feeling like this, I know I've gotten triggerd by thte World Cup. Canada's first game and against Belgium was something Sam anf I dreamed of, it's painful because I so badly want to curl up wiith her on the couch and watch it with her. My feelings for Sam often overwhelm me, they get amplified; even now, when important things happen. Sam's always who comes to mind instantly.  
  
I know that is a bit insane, I haven't seen or spoken to hear in over a year.
