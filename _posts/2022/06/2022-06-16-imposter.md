A lot of the time I struggle with the words I am saying, for some reason I have trouble believing what I am saying. It's not that I don't mean what I am saying, I do but it feels almost like I am faking it, it doesn't feel sincere to me.  

I've learned that there's a name for this, Imposter Syndrome and it's likely that because I haven't had my new ideas and beliefs "tested" yet it's hard for me to accept that I do have these new skills and I am much stringer now. It's such a strange thing, for me at least, I'm generally pretty confident and don;t shy away from sharing my feelings.
