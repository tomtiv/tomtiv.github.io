This whole process's has been horrible and I wouldn't wish this kind of pain and suffering on anyone for any reason. WHich is why no matter how much I process, how many feeling I work through, I still can't even remotely understand one part of all this.  
  
How did Sam make the decision to cut everything about us out of her life, how did she act like we never happened? How do you knowingly cause someone she said you loved that kind of pain, when you didn't have to, it didn't have to be like this.  

I'll never understand this kind of cruelty.
