***The Trauma Triangle***  
I'm sure I heard that from someplace, but it gave me some of the missing pieces I was looking for. None of the terms I had been given really fit on on their own, but when you ses them as a triangle it suddenly makes a lot fo sense.

***I was in a Trauma Bonded, co-dependant, enmeshed relationship with Sam***  
  
You may think that's a bad thing, but it's not. It doesn't invalidate how I felt about her and us. It doesn't make require either of us to be a bad person either. These were two concepts I struggled with, I knew they weren't true and I wasn't willing to accept either of those labels. It's a nice feeling to know that sticking to what I knew was true in my heart wasn't hindering my healing and processing, I just took a long time work out my emotional vocabulary so I could express these kinds of complex ideas.  
  
So yay! me!
