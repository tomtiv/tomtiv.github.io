I feel like I am on death row just counting the hours and minutes before my execution. I know the way I feel is unreasonable, I have no reason to think friday will be any different then any other day. The bad things happened close to 9 months ago, and there is no reason for any kind for hope. Sam made the decision that she felt was best for her and that hasn't changed in any way, I have no idea if Sam has ever even thought about me since she left.  

I know I'll make it through this like I have made it through everything else in my life, this is just the first time that I have ever not wanted to move on, I never thought I would have to move on, I truly believed I had found my future.
