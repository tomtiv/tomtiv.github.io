Today has been the hardest days I've had in a while, I had to get support from Zee again today. I miss Sam so much and I am so scared to go through the next couple of weeks on my own. Every minute of everyday will be a constant reminder of her. This id the 1st Canada day that I am dreading, it's always been a day I looked forward to and it became my favorite day of the year once I met Sam.  

So how the hell did it all end up like this, I really wish I knew, I really wish this wasn't happening.
