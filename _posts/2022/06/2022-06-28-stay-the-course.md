I decided not to contact Sam at all, I very much want to but that's the main problem. I can't be sure if I want to contact her in hopes of something positive happening between us or if I really am only trying to tie up lose ends. If I end up making the decision on my own, then it will be my decision and I will be the one that is responsible for that decision.  

The week is getting progressively harder and harder to deal with, I've had to lean on Zee pretty much everyday.
