All of a sudden I was overcome with sadness, It took me a minute to understand what was going on, why I was feeling so sad. I realized it was Father's Day and while I am not a father, I felt like I had lost my last chance to have a family. Sam and I had talked often about having children, to the point where she went of her birth control a few months before we ended. I know I feel the lose of what could have been as Sam and me would have recently had or on the verge of having our first child.
