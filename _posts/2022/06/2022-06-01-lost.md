Almost 8 months later and I feel like I am getting worse not better, how did I end up here?  
How in the world did I get myself into this kind of situation?  
Why\how could anyone behave the way Sam has? What in the world could she be thinking?  

The first 3 months are a complete blur for me school and surviving was all I could do.  
January and February aren't much better but at least I had started to process things.  
Late feb, early march I started therapy, it was so intense and all consuming the next thing I know it's June.  

Sam never, not once reached out to me, she refused to respond to questions about insurance, her belonging, the cats.  
She left me in the dark intensionally and maliciously, and yet again I let her do it, why do I keep letting her mistreat me?

What is so fucking special about her, that I have pretty much thrown away a year of my life, in hopes we work it out???
What kind of person swears you are the love of their life then disappears without a word?

***BECAUSE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS***
