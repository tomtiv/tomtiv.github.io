I watched Olivia Rodrigo's making of her album, it blows me away that a little kid can write like that. Not just that either, that she felt a lof of the same feelings I have and have struggled with, Her album Sour reminds me a lot of Alanis Morissette Jagged Little Pill. I'm not sure if it's me or just where I am in life but Sour feels unapologetically visceral and she's not pandering to anyone or anything which is something I love.  

Ine thing she said that hit home with me was that she was worried if she would be able to write more songs when she doesn't have that pain and suffering in her life. It's something I struggle with, will I ever find something like that again but be able to make it healthy and safe?
