Today I have my last meeting with both of my angels. I'm sad and I feel like I am losing my constant but I am so thankful to both of them. I have no idea where I would be without them.  

Thank you both so much!

***Update***  
After having my appointment with my Angels, I realized that I'll never lose them. The skills they have taught me, the exploring we have done together and even the sound of their voices, I will carry with me and they are both just a thought away anytime I need them.
