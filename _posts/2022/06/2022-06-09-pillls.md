I've spent a lot of time doing research and self improvement but one thing I have come across is these idiots that talk about black, red and blue pills or these pickup artists. I didn't really think people took it seriously but apparently people live by it. That's one thing I can be thankful for, I don't give a shit what people think, I've dated beautiful, ugly, skinny, fat, intelligent, simple, boring and fascinating. Every single time the same qualities win out, good conversation, interested in living life, and willing to work together to build something.  

No woman comes remotely close to how I felt about Sam, I was initially attracted to her intellectually, I loved talking to her and spending time with her. Sam is by no means unattractive, she's beautiful, when looks are the 2nd or 3rd thing you love about someone, well I Can't imagine a better place to be.
