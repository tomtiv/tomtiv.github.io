Today I started packing for hell week, I started with our scuba gear. I waited on doing it as along as I could, but I have to safety check and get some things fixed. I knew it was going to be hard but it was a lot harder than I imagined.  
  
The moment I opened up the gear bag, I was flooded with memories, with 1 exception, all my water related memories with Sam are wonderful. So it's not surprising that this was a major trigger for me.
