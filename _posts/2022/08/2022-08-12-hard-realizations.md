I was caught off guard when my phone rang, I had forgotten that Zee and I had an earlier session today. Normally I have tings pre planned that I want to talk about usually things that I felt or experienced since our last session, but today I wasn't prepared so when I answered I had nothing to say, or at least I thought, turned out that I had a lot to talk about.
