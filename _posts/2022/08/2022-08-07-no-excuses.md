These past few days have been so f-ing hard, I've spent a lot of time going over things that happened between Me and Sam. This time I wasn't considering what she did or what she said, I was solely focused on my actions and my emotions.  

I'm not going to lie, it was f-ing hard to do, I couldn't justify or excuse anything because of someone else. I had to look at my actions and emotions that I wasn't ok with happening, yet I had done or said them. Boundaries for others are talked about all the time, but having boundaries for myself is just as important. There were times I hated myself for things I did or said and I'm not ok with that and I never want to feel that way about myself again.
