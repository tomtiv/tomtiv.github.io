I always prided myself on the fact that with Sam I was always open and honest with her, I never wanted to hide anything from her. I did my best so when I made a mistake (or was a complete ass) , I owned up, took responsibility and did my best to fix it. I also quite often either took or felt responsible for things that were not mine to take, I did so, because I wanted to protect her from as much bad as I could. I'm not responsible for what her parents did or how they treated Sam and I. I'm not responsible for Sam not having friends or choosing not to have anything outside of us. I'm not responsible for Sam's inability to communicate or her episodes, I felt responsible for a lot of those things at one point or another.  

That probably sounded like I was trying to blame Sam, but that's no my intension at all. I think I have done a pretty good job writing about my mistakes and things I did wrong, I wanted to talk about things I did wrong by taking  when it wasn't mine to take.
