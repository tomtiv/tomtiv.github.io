July was a very unexpected month, things changed a lot for me. Yet sometimes I have flashbacks and I remember things that I had either blocked out or forgotten. I still stand by my belief that neither Sam or I did bad things to each other on purpose, I know for me almost everything I did or said came from a good place originally, but when some of these memories come back, I am in shock how she and I talked and treated each other sometimes.
