I have been lucky enough to go away multiple times this summer, I've been on vacation for close to a month when you add it all up. I wanted to make sure that even while I was on vacation I continued with my therapy. What I have found works, is keeping my 3 appointments but keeping them to 30 mins, instead of the normal hour. I don't really want to open any new wounds while I'm away, so just checking in and reminding myself all the progress and how much better I understand myself has worked well. It would have been easy to just not think about anything and deal with it when I was home. So I guess Yah me for sticking to my goals!
