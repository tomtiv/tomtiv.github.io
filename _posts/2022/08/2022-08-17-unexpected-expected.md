I had the strangest feeling today, it felt like something had changed. I'm not sure why I thought it would be this one particular thing but it was. Sam made a decision that would affect me and didn't bother telling me about it, just let me find out on my own. It's a really mean way to treat someone and after all this time, I hoped that I would at least get a bit of decency from her. I'm not surprised that she made the decision, but I guess I was surprised by it.
