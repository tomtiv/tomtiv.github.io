We went to the locks today, I wouldn't say that I was triggered or even sad really, I wished things were different but that was out of my control. I am enjoying life the best I can with the people in my life right now.  
  
While I was there I had the strangest feeling, it felt like something had changed. There's nothing left between me and Sam except the one year apart day and one other thing, so I looked and sure enough it was the last thing between me and Sam. In typical fashion, Sam made a decision that would affect me and didn't bother telling me about it, just let me find out on my own. It's a really mean way to treat someone and after all this time, I hoped that I would at least get a bit of decency from her.
