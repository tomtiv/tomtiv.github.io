I was tempted to delete this because as it turns out I was wrong about all of this, Sam didn't do anything. I'm leaving the post up because I want to show that even after all my growth I still make mistakes and jump to conclusions. It's ok to be make mistakes but I want to make sure I take responsibility.  

-------------------  

I had the strangest feeling today, it felt like something had changed. I'm not sure why I thought it would be this one particular thing but it was. Sam made a decision that would affect me and didn't bother telling me about it, just let me find out on my own. It's a really mean way to treat someone and after all this time, I hoped that I would at least get a bit of decency from her. I'm not surprised that she made the decision, but it was unexpected, I expected it to happen in a couple of months.
