***LAST UPDATE: Nov 2022***  

***Q: Why did I stop working on this site?***  
***A:*** Short answer is that this past year was so incredably difficult and while I've learned so much I am just starting my journey. I am not going to stop writing, I feel that changing the narrative and direction would be much more usefull to me and potentialy others.  

***Q: What was it like to find out you were BPD?***  
***A:*** It's very difficult to put it into words. It was terrifying but at the same time familiar, it finally gave me insight into why I had such strong emotions and unable to weather them.

***Q: Have you gotten over the breakup?***  
***A:*** For the most part yes, I've made peace with the end of our relationship, I'm still struggling with why we couldn't make it work when we both so badly wanted it to work.

***Q: Have either of you tried to contact the other since?***  
***A:*** No  

***Q: Are you still in therapy?***  
***A:*** Yes, I'm still with Zee, I'm doing two hours a week for now, but it's much more targeted and about me, it's not about our relationship anymore.  

***Q: Why haven't you finished posting about the cottages (2022)?***  
***A:*** It's been a few months now and it just doesn't feel important anymore. I've written about pretty much everything I could say in one way or another.  

***Q: How do you feel about Sam now?***  
***A:*** I love her, I always will but I don't think I will ever be able to forgive her for ghosting me and completely invalidating 5 years of my life. This action will likely have long term consequences for both of us. It's no way to treat someone, especially someone you claim to love.  

<!-- 
I have experienced and caused more pain, hurt, destruction and heartbreak over the past 5 years, 80% of the last 14 months, then I have in my whole life. That may sound dramatic, and we all know I can be dramatic at times, but this time, sadly for the first time, this is my truth.  

Do I regret meeting Sam, no! She's been the most important person in my life for as long as I can remember. I'm in love with her, and that will never change. Would I do it all again? Knowing how it would play out over 5 years? I don't know, I really don't know, I want to say of course I would. We didn't last forever but that doesn't make it any less real, that we loved each other any less. I can't say I would do it all again anymore, the work I have done on and for myself can't be undone and I as a person would not enter that kind of a relationship again.
