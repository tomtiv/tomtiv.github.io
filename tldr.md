I have experienced and caused more pain, hurt, destruction and heartbreak over the past 5 years, 80% of the last 14 months, then I have in my whole life. That may sound dramatic, and we all know I can be dramatic at times, but this time, sadly for the first time, this is my truth.  

Do I regret meeting Sam, no! She's been the most important person in my life for as long as I can remember. I'm in love with her, and that will never change. Would I do it all again? Knowing how it would play out over 5 years? I don't know, I really don't know, I want to say of course I would. We didn't last forever but that doesn't make it any less real, that we loved each other any less. I can't say I would do it all again anymore, the work I have done on and for myself can't be undone and I as a person would not enter that kind of a relationship again.
