**Warning:** If you are in a vulnerable place, I strongly suggest that you look for support locally. 
While these are good resources, it is by no means a linear path, it takes a lot of time and energy.

### YouTube

[Heidi Pribe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqX3KQWXJll7_6orfHFuqBQ)
I found her very late in my journey, Heidi is a great resource, She goes much deeper into many different topics.

[B BPD](https://www.youtube.com/c/BBPD123)
B's focuses on what it's like for her to live with BPD, she's a really great place to learn about BPD that ignores all the toxic stuff you will see online.

[Madison DeCambra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxgKcMK8ajk&t=1s)
Madison gives a very real and for me bang on explanation what BPD feels like for her and me

[Ask Craig](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO60mX6WGDgrk0R27c8COKQ)
I found this channel to be the best resource by far. There's no doubt they know what they are doing, They talk a lot about attachment and other more advanced topics. It's not required to know any of it, but you would be doing yourself a huge favor by stating with the basics. they have over 700 videas and a bunch of playlists

Thais daily videos are hit or miss, sometimes the videos are 1/2 ads and other times she has great information. This is where I would start if you truly want to do the work. She covers a lot of topics and makes them every easy to understand. You cna;t go wrong with this one, it just takes time. Thais also has the Personal Development School are a great resource, but it's very expensive. I would only suggest joining if you are not able to get a therapist locally.

[The Truth of Love](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheTruthofLove)
Clutch's videos are different then the rest, he's looking at things from less of a textbook place, which I found to be a nice change ge of pace.There's also a free Discord server, I was on it for about a month. It's well worth joining, especially if you are struggling. The motto is No Spiraling and they mean it.
