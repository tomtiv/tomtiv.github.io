**Warning:** If you are in a vulnerable place, I strongly suggest that you look for support locally. 
While these are good resources, it is by no means a linear path, it takes a lot of time and energy.



### YouTube

I found this channel to the best resource by far. There's no doubt they know what they are doing, They talk a lot about attachment and other more advanced topics. It's not required to know any of it, but you woudld be doing yourself a huge favor by stating with the basics. they have over 700 videas and a bunch of playlists

Thais daily videos are hit or miss, sometimes the video are 1/2 ads and other times she has great information. This is where I would start if you truly want to do the work. She covers a lot of topics and makes them every easy to understand. You cna;t go wrong with this one, it just takes time. Thais also has the Personal Development School are a great resource, but it's very expensive. I would only suggest joinnig if you are not able to get a therapist locally.

Clutch's videos are diffrent then the rest, he's looking at thigns from less of a textbook place, which I found to be a nice change ge of pace.
There's also a free Dicord server, I was on it for abotu a month. It's well worth joining, especially if you are struggling. The motot is No Spiraling and they mean it.

I found her very late in my journey, while she does tailors her videos to her Personality type, which is ENFP. She goes much deeper into other topics as well. She hasn't been making as many videos but I've seen all of them.
