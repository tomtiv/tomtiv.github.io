My name is Thomas, ADHD, Anxious PreOccupied, ENFJ   

### My story
In Late 2021, I experienced a very unexpected loss. After having a fight with my wife Sam, she left our home. The following day I got a 4 line email saying she was done. That was the last time I ever heard from Sam.
   
I created this site out of necessity, I was devastated, I had no idea what happened, I was in denial most of the time.I truly couldn't imagine my life without her. So I needed a way to processing all the feelings and thoughts I was having.I needed a place to store some of my pain and sadness, it was too much for me to carry myself.
That's what this site is all about.
