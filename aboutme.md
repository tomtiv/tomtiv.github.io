### My story

In Late 2021, I experienced a very unexpected loss. After having a fight with my wife, she left our home. The following day I got a 4 line email saying she was done. That was the last time I ever heard from her, which was 7 months at the time I wrote this.

I created this site out of neccesaty, I was devistsated, I had no idea what happened, I was in denial most of the time.
I truly couldn't imagine my life wiht out her. So I needed away to processing all the feelings and thoughts I was having.
I needed a place to store some of me pain and sadness, it was too much for me to carry myself.

In early 2022, I got l=extermely lucky and was able to get counselling, which I'm doing 3 days a week. 

That's what this site is all about.
