I'm happy that I created this blog and I was able to write about about and process some deep emotions I'm just learning about.
I don't think at this point it's helpful anymore, I've been ruminating excessively for months now. I've grown so much in some ways  
but in others I haven't really changed at all.  

Sam abandoned me, she blames me for everything, she left me to solely deal with all our bills, pets and belongings.  
The highlight of all this is she feels justified because she believes this is a clean break.  

I'm finally seeing her for who she truly is, the fog is dissipating, the addiction is wearing off and I am seeing clearer now.
There is absolutely no way I will allow myself to be in a relationship with that kind of person.

Sam The Door Is Now Closed Permanently
