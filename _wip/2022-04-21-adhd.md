I have ADHD, it's a complex disorder and has a terrible name. It presents in every person diffrently,   
what makes it's even more fun is that it will likely present diffrently in the same person day to day.
Havng ADHD does not mean I am bored or disintrested or lazy, it is much more complicated then that.
   
You hear the term flight, fight, freeze or fawn. I have always felt like I was in fight, fight or fight mode. 
This can be debilitating at times and it can make some thigns feel almost impossible.   

I also have 2 co-morbidities which are 
- Opposition Defiance Disorder (ODD)
- Rejection Sensitivity Disorder (RSD)
   
I'll explore each of thsese in a future post
