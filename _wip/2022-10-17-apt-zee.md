I've had a few situations and emotions come up for me over the past few weeks that I don't know how to deal with in a health way. So I reached out to Zee and asked for an extended session so I could work through my entire thought process. These are the things I want to talk to Zee about.  
  
- How to see if my GP is someone that can support me or not (MY GP is fantastic, but there may be conflicts and biases)
- My comments about the song "Hold My Hand" and how problematic my comments are for my emotional stability
- Sam and Jess polR 
- Sam, Jess, Sam, Jess
- Cute Aggression
- Charm (Childlike)
- Dating?
-
