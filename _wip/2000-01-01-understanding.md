It really did take me 6 months to accept that you weren't coming back. 
I knew you were the one for me, I was sure we were meant for each other and we would have a lifetime together.
I was and still am in love you, I can't imagine ever not being in love with you.

What happened that night has happend a few times in the past by both of us.
But we always came back toeach other, but that didnt; happen this time.

I'm really struggling, I'm in pain, I feel lost and I can't seem to let go of you.

I am not loooking to to change your mind or to rehas things with you.







The truth is that I had no idea why you left in the first place. 
I had no idea why you all of a sudden didn't love me, didn't want to be with me.
