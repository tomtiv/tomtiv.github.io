The most importnat thing in life for me has always been finding that special someone that I could share my life with but I've always been 
extremely selective in who I am willing to let in.  


Testing - pushing her away when I really want her to come close

I rarely yell when I am legitimately mad about something. 
When I get angry and yell at her, it's almost always becuase I am feeling unregulated and looking to her to help me get grounded.


very protective of oru connection
