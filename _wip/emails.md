I waited my whole life to meet you, when I did, it was wonderful, amazing, heartbreaking and everything else I could have imagined. The only thing that I never considered was that we would end. Now somehow I'm supposed to just forget you, I'm supposed to forget the love of my life, I'm supposed to forget I ever met you.

I don't know how to do that.
